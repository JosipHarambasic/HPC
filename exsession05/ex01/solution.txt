computing the .c file we can use cc or gcc file.c and we get an executable
but for .cpp files we need another compiler either CC or g++ and then we get an executable of the .cpp file.

for .c files we can't use new instead of malloc. This will cause an error. In cpp new is passible and works fine.

I just print something to check if the vector addition works.
