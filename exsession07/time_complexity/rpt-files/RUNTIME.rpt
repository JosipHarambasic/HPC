Observation:  MPI utilization

    No suggestions were made because each node has only one rank.


Observation:  Program sensitivity to memory latency

    The relatively low memory bandwidth utilization but significant rate
    of stalls in the program suggest that its performance is limited by
    memory latency.
    It could be beneficial to improve prefetching in loops in functions
    high in the profile, by modifying compiler-generated prefetches or
    inserting directives into the source code.


Observation:  Program sensitivity to vectorization:

    This program did not appear to be limited by low vectorization
    throughout its entire execution, though individual functions or
    regions might be.


Notes for table 3:

  This table shows memory traffic for numa nodes, taking for each numa
    node the maximum value across nodes. It also shows the balance in
    memory traffic by showing the top 3 and bottom 3 node values.
  For further explanation, see the "General table notes" below,
    or use:  pat_report -v -O mem_bw ...

Notes for table 4:

  This table shows energy and power usage for the nodes with the
    maximum, mean, and minimum usage, as well as the sum of usage over
    all nodes.
    Energy and power for accelerators is also shown, if applicable.
  For further explanation, see the "General table notes" below,
    or use:  pat_report -v -O program_energy ...
