For the $Home firectory: "drwx------"
I only have access permissions all the others are set to -,  
The $HOME directory from others can't be accessed from my side. This should prevent from voulnerabilties (modification or deleting)
Default permission for directories is: "drwxr-xr-x"
Default permission for files is: "-rw-r--r--"


The $SCRATCH: "drwxr-xr-x"
I can access others $SCRATCH directory but only read and execute already writtenfiles, this should prevent from vulnerabilities. (Deleting files or modifiying them)
Default permission for directories: "drwxr-xr-x"  
Default permission for files: "-rw-r--r--"

Graded:
If I want to access /users/jbucko if got the error message: -bash: cd: jbucko/: Keine Berechtigung --> no permission
So since I can't read it and don't have permission I can't write it also.
I can check if I have permission with the command ls -ld /users/jbucko 
and get this permission logged: "drwx------+"
So I'm unable to see or write anything even if I know there is a file.

The command that allows only the owner full access is: chmod 700
If I create a file with chmod 000 file.txt, then the file is lost. I can't open or delete it.
