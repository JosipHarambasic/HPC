Ex 2.2
cc = Compiler that we use
-O3 = optimise to the max we can extend it also with -ffast-math and -mavx2 
If we change it to -O0 the code is slower than -O3 (it takes longer)

Ex. 2.3
We See a A Partition Available Jobs info. So time limit for tasks are 30mins and how many CPUS can be used debug CPU = 72 etc.
