HPC

Ex 2.2
cc = Compiler that we use
-O3 = optimise to the max we can extend it also with -ffast-math and -mavx2 
If we change it to -O0 the code is slower than -O3 (it takes longer)

Ex. 2.3
We See a A Partition Available Jobs info. So time limit for tasks are 30mins and how many CPUS can be used debug CPU = 72 etc. 

Ex. 3
We need to create the $sbatch script with the generator. 
Then we can add the batch script to $SCRATCH. 
Copy the executable to the $SCRATCH.
The $sbatch script needs to contain the same name at the bottom as the executable. 
Then we can run sbatch cpi_omp
And wait until the job is done.
We then get an output like this „slurm-37078765.out“ and can see what happened.
The same we can do for cpi_mpi, just change the tasks per node and cpus per task.
To See the log we can add 
#SBATCH --error=error.log
#SBATCH --output=output.log
To the script file and then we see the both files after adding our jobs
