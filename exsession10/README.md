##Exercise 1


We can see that the first computation takes longer than the other 4 compuations.
This is because the GPU needs to load the modules and the data. After that it is much faster for the other compuations. A weird error occurs when adding --mail-user, it show me an error by running the script but accidentaly I added a $ instead of a # and it worked but it shows an small error in the output file but it works.
